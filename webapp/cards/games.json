        "body": "Our first game, published back in 2008 on the Xbox 360. A very simple twin-stick shooter.\n\nWe pulled the game from the store in 2010 while getting ready for a major 2.0 re-release that greatly expanded types of gameplay, graphics, and gameplay options. Unfortunately, just days before we were planning to launch, a power surge fried our working copy of the code and files and the most recent copy we could recover was several months old.\n\nWanting to move on to other projects, we decided to abandon the game entirely instead of redoing several months of work."
