## Remote Work & Flexibility

Stoic Dreams is a distributed-first company. We believe great work isn't tied to a location - it's built on trust, autonomy, and thoughtful communication. Our remote work policies are designed to support flexibility while maintaining strong collaboration and deep focus.

## :house_with_garden: Remote by Default

- All roles at Stoic Dreams are remote.
- We don't require relocation or in-office presence.
- We hire based on capability, not proximity.

## :clock10: Async-First Culture

We default to asynchronous communication so everyone can:

- Work in focused blocks, not frantic meetings.
- Contribute across time zones.
- Respond thoughtfully, not reactively.

We prioritize clear writing and documentation over real-time chatter.

## :calendar: Core Hours & Flex Scheduling

We respect the reality of different time zones and personal lives. Our flexible work system includes:

- A shared 4-hour daily "core window" (9AM PST - 1PM PST) for scheduled collaboration (online meetings) when needed.
- Flexible start and end times outside those hours.
- No expectation of being online 9-to-5.

We expect a 6 hour work day. When you work those 6 hours is up to you.

## :baby_bottle: Life Happens-We Adapt

Whether it's caregiving, illness, or just needing a break, we trust our team to manage their time responsibly.

- Need to step away? Communicate clearly, and we'll support you.
- Emergencies and time off are never penalized.
- PTO and flexible hours are not just allowed - they're encouraged.

## :key: Our Philosophy on Flexibility

- **Autonomy fuels excellence.**
- **Trust builds culture.**
- **Balance makes sustainability possible.**

Flexibility isn't a perk - it's part of how we work.
