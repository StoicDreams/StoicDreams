## Work-Life Balance & Mental Health

At Stoic Dreams, we believe that a healthy team is a productive team. Burnout is not a badge of honor. We've built our culture around boundaries, rest, and support - because long-term impact is only possible when people are well.

## :sunny: PTO and Rest

- Every full-time team member receives **at least 4 weeks of paid time off** annually.
- PTO is not accrued - it's available from day one.
- We encourage you to use your time off and truly disconnect when you do.

In addition to PTO, we offer:

- Company-wide **mental health days** throughout the year
- Encouragement to take **no-meeting days** for deep work and recharge
- Encouragement to take **side-project days** to work on side projects and new ideas

## :brain: Mental Health Support

We recognize that mental health is just as important as physical health. Our approach includes:

- Access to wellness stipends or reimbursements (where legally supported)
- Flexible hours for therapy or personal care appointments
- Mental health as a normal and open topic - not a taboo

No one should feel like they have to "power through" when struggling.

## :zzz: Boundaries Are Respected

- We don't glorify overwork or late-night slogs.
- Slack, email, and meetings are not expected outside your working hours.
- We turn off notifications during rest periods and holidays.

## :key: Our Commitment

- **You are more than your output.**
- **You don't need to be "always on" to be valued.**
- **Your health matters to us.**

Balance isn't a bonus - it's a foundation.
