## Decision-Making & Transparency

At Stoic Dreams, we operate on trust, not control. We believe the best decisions come from shared understanding, open dialogue, and clear communication. Transparency is a default - not an afterthought.

## :bar_chart: Open by Default

We share key decisions and company performance information internally, including:

- Company financials and major expenses
- Product roadmaps and priorities
- Hiring plans and org changes

Everyone should understand how the business operates and how their work contributes to the bigger picture.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Informed, Inclusive Decisions

We strive to include the right people in decisions - especially those affected by the outcome.

- Cross-functional collaboration is expected and encouraged
- Input is gathered before key decisions, not after
- Final calls are clearly communicated along with reasoning

Decision-making authority is clear, but not siloed.

## :clipboard: Shared Governance on Key Policies

For policies that impact the whole team (e.g. handbook updates, time off policy, salary bands), we:

- Propose changes with context and rationale
- Gather team feedback asynchronously
- Document and archive final decisions

This helps build a culture of consent, not surprise.

## :memo: Transparent Communication

We default to public channels, not private chats.

- Team-wide updates are posted regularly
- Meeting notes and decisions are documented and shared
- Big changes are never made in the dark

Transparency helps prevent misalignment and builds lasting trust.

## :key: Our Approach

- **Clarity over secrecy.**
- **Inclusion over hierarchy.**
- **Trust over control.**

When people understand the "why," they care more about the "how."
