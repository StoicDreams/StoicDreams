## Learning & Development

At Stoic Dreams, we believe growth is not just encouraged - it's expected. We hire people not only for what they can do today, but for what they can become over time. That's why we invest in continuous learning and professional development for everyone on the team.

## :books: Ongoing Education

We allocate time and budget to ensure every team member has opportunities to grow:

- Annual **learning stipends** to spend on courses, books, or tools
- Paid time during the workweek for self-directed learning
- Support for conference attendance or workshop participation (virtual or in-person)

Learning is a team priority, not a personal burden.

## :seedling: Mentorship & Peer Support

We foster a culture where people learn from each other:

- Mentorship programs and internal pairing for skill-building
- Peer review as a learning process, not just quality control
- Internal show-and-tell sessions to share what we're exploring

Growth isn't a solo activity - it's a shared journey.

## :bulb: Career Growth Paths

Everyone at Stoic Dreams should understand how they can advance.

- We provide clearly documented **career ladders** for each role
- Promotions are based on impact, initiative, and peer feedback - not tenure
- Lateral growth (e.g., switching roles or domains) is supported and encouraged

You don't need to become a manager to be seen as a leader, nor an executive to garner the top salary/bonuses.

## :scroll: Documentation as a Learning Tool

We believe that teaching is one of the best ways to learn.

- Employees are encouraged to write internal guides and share discoveries
- All major systems and practices are documented in a living knowledge base
- We value clarity in writing and communication as a key professional skill

## :key: Our Development Philosophy

- **Growth is expected - and supported.**
- **Learning is part of the job - not extra credit.**
- **Everyone is both a student and a teacher.**

We succeed when our people grow.
