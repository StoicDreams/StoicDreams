## Our Mission and Values

At Stoic Dreams, we're building more than just products - we're building a company rooted in purpose, integrity, and long-term vision. Our mission is to create tools and platforms that empower creators and developers while operating with a deep respect for fairness and transparency.

## :sparkles: Our Core Values

### 1. **Integrity Over Optics**

We do what's right, not what looks good. Our decisions are guided by principle, not PR.

### 2. **Transparency as a Default**

We believe in sharing how and why decisions are made. Internally and externally, transparency builds trust.

### 3. **Craftsmanship and Care**

We take pride in building things well, even if it takes longer. Quality matters - always.

### 4. **People Over Profits**

We value long-term relationships and fair compensation over short-term gains. Employees and contributors are not disposable.

### 5. **Inclusion and Accessibility**

Everyone should feel welcome. We actively build for, hire from, and listen to diverse perspectives.

### 6. **Open Knowledge**

We believe in contributing back - whether through open-source projects, shared documentation, or public transparency like this handbook.

### 7. **Long-Term Thinking**

We optimize for resilience, not speed. Our projects are built to last and evolve, not to burn out or cash out.

## :handshake: Our Commitment

We don't just post values on a wall - we live them in our hiring, our compensation, our policies, and our culture. This handbook is one of the many ways we hold ourselves accountable to the standards we set.
