## Anti-Harassment & Inclusion Policy

Stoic Dreams is committed to creating a workplace where everyone fee ls safe, respected, and valued. We do not tolerate harassment or discrimination of any kind - online, offline, in public or private.

We don't just strive to "avoid harm" - we aim to build a culture of active inclusion, care, and mutual respect.

## :no_entry: Zero Tolerance for Harassment

Harassment of any kind is grounds for immediate action. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Verbal abuse, slurs, or offensive jokes
- Unwanted sexual attention or advances
- Bullying, intimidation, or threats
- Disrespectful behavior in meetings, chats, or emails

Harassment doesn't need to be intentional to be harmful. Impact matters more than intent.

## :rainbow: Inclusion Is Ongoing Work

Inclusion isn't a checkbox - it's an ongoing practice. At Stoic Dreams:

- We use inclusive language in documentation, code, and communication
- We design products and processes with accessibility in mind
- We create space for feedback and learning without shame

We especially aim to support and uplift people from historically marginalized groups - including but not limited to BIPOC, LGBTQIA+, disabled, and neurodivergent individuals.

## :loudspeaker: Clear Reporting Channels

We take all reports seriously and respond promptly.

- You can report concerns anonymously or directly to leadership
- Reports are kept confidential and investigated fairly
- Retaliation of any kind is not tolerated

We offer support and will take immediate steps to protect anyone experiencing harassment or discrimination.

## :shield: Leadership Responsibility

Creating a safe environment is not just HR's job - it starts at the top.

- Leaders are expected to model inclusive behavior
- Every manager is trained to recognize and respond to harassment
- Inclusion goals are part of performance reviews for leadership roles

## :key: Our Stance

We don't tolerate harmful behavior. We act on it.
