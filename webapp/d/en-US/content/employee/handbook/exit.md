## Exit Philosophy

People leave companies for many reasons - and that's okay. At Stoic Dreams, we treat departures with the same respect and care as we treat onboarding. Whether someone is moving on, changing paths, or stepping away, we handle exits with dignity, gratitude, and transparency.

## :wave: Respectful Offboarding

When someone leaves Stoic Dreams, we:

- Provide a clear, humane offboarding process
- Ensure final pay, benefits, and documentation are handled promptly
- Invite feedback and offer support for the transition

We don't ghost or burn bridges - leaving should be just as respectful as joining.

## :speech_balloon: Honest Exit Conversations

We value feedback from those who are departing. Exit conversations help us:

- Understand what we could have done better
- Celebrate what worked well
- Improve the experience for future team members

All feedback is confidential and handled constructively.

## :busts_in_silhouette: Alumni Network

Leaving the company doesn't mean leaving the community.

- Former team members are welcome in our alumni Slack and newsletter (opt-in)
- We celebrate your future successes and may collaborate again
- Recommendations and referrals are gladly provided when deserved

We see alumni as ambassadors - not burnouts.

## :umbrella: Layoffs and Restructuring

If we ever face a situation where roles must be eliminated:

- We will communicate as early and clearly as possible
- Severance, benefits extension, and support will be offered
- The process will be handled with empathy and transparency

We hope never to face this - but we plan as if we might.

## :key: Our Exit Ethos

- **People are not disposable.**
- **Departures deserve dignity.**
- **Gratitude continues beyond employment.**

Leaving Stoic Dreams should be a closing chapter - not a burned bridge.
