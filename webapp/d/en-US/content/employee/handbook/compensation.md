## Compensation & Salary Standards

At Stoic Dreams, we believe compensation should be fair, transparent, and rooted in long-term ethics - not negotiation games or opaque pay structures. We've designed our salary model to promote profit sharing, reduce inequality, and ensure that everyone is valued.

## :money_with_wings: Salary Ratio Cap

To maintain fairness and reduce wage inequality, we've established a clear compensation boundary:

> **No employee, including founders or executives, will earn more than 5x the salary of the lowest-paid full-time employee.**

This ensures that growth benefits the whole team - not just those at the top.

## :ledger: Transparent Pay Bands

- Every role at Stoic Dreams has a clearly defined salary band.
- These bands are published internally and, in many cases, externally.
- Raises and promotions are tied to responsibility and impact, not personality or politics.

## :seedling: Entry-Level Commitment

- We set a high baseline salary to ensure all employees - regardless of role - are paid fairly and can thrive.
- Interns and junior employees are paid competitive, livable wages with no expectation of "working their way up" without support.

## :handshake: No Negotiation Games

We know that traditional negotiation culture often reinforces inequality. To reduce bias and reward transparency:

- We offer the highest fair rate from the start.
- Offers come with a full breakdown of pay, benefits, and profit sharing.
- There is no penalty for not negotiating.

## :gift: Benefits and Profit Sharing

We offer a package that reflects the full value of each contributor:

- Health and wellness benefits (where legally applicable)
- Profit-sharing models for long-term contributors
- Time off, learning budgets, and mental health resources

## :key: Our Compensation Ethos

- **Fair:** Every employee is treated with equal respect and consideration.
- **Transparent:** Pay isn't a secret - it's a system.
- **Sustainable:** We balance responsible business growth with ethical compensation.
