## Open Source & Public Good

Stoic Dreams was built on the shoulders of open-source software and shared knowledge. We believe in giving back - not just to the tools we use, but to the communities and ecosystems that make ethical, sustainable technology possible.

## :scroll: Why Open Source Matters

Open source is more than code - it's a philosophy. It reflects our commitment to:

- Transparency over secrecy
- Collaboration over competition
- Knowledge as a commons, not a commodity

We support open tools because they empower creativity, independence, and long-term resilience.

## :gear: Our Contribution Model

At Stoic Dreams, open-source contribution is part of our development rhythm - not an afterthought.

- We dedicate **at least 10% of engineering time** to open-source projects.
- This includes maintaining our own libraries, contributing to upstream tools, or sharing internal solutions that could help others.
- We prioritize documentation and accessibility in all our shared code.

Open-source work is evaluated as part of performance and impact - not treated as extracurricular.

## :books: Public Knowledge & Transparency

In addition to open-source code, we believe in open practices:

- Public documentation of our internal frameworks and philosophies
- Transparent handbooks like this one
- Blog posts, talks, and educational resources

We want others to build on what we've learned - mistakes and all.

## :handshake: Ethical Ecosystems

We're intentional about the tools, vendors, and partners we choose:

- We avoid platforms that exploit users or extract data without consent.
- We support organizations and communities that align with our values.
- When possible, we donate to or sponsor open-source maintainers whose work we rely on.

## :key: Our Pledge

- **Share what we build.**
- **Support what we use.**
- **Respect the commons we benefit from.**

Open source is not just a responsibility - it's a privilege.
