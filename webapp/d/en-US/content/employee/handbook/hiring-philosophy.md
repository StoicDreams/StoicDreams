## Hiring Philosophy

At Stoic Dreams, hiring is not just about filling roles - it's about building a team rooted in shared purpose, mutual respect, and long-term alignment. We're committed to an ethical, inclusive, and bias-conscious hiring process that values people for their ideas, their growth potential, and their lived experience.

## :mag_right: What We Look For

We seek individuals who are:

- Aligned with our mission and values
- Eager to learn and grow, regardless of formal background
- Thoughtful, communicative, and collaborative
- Committed to long-term craftsmanship over short-term hacks

Degrees and resumes are secondary to character, passion, and proven curiosity.

## :seedling: Fair and Ethical Practices

We have a zero-tolerance policy for exploitative labor. This means:

- **No unpaid internships** or volunteer roles.
- **No trial projects without pay.**
- **Clear contracts** with defined compensation and expectations.

All candidates are treated with dignity, given timely feedback, and respected throughout the process.

## :balance_scale: Equal Opportunity

We actively design our hiring process to reduce unconscious bias and open doors to those often overlooked in tech, including:

- Candidates without traditional degrees
- Career changers and self-taught developers
- People from underrepresented and marginalized backgrounds

Accessibility is built into our job listings, interviews, and communications. If you need accommodations, we're ready to support you.

## :speech_balloon: Transparent Process

Our hiring process includes:

1. A clearly defined role and salary band
2. A fair and consistent interview flow
3. Optional take-home tasks with fair compensation
4. Transparency on status and timeline

We want every candidate, hired or not, to walk away feeling respected and informed.

## :key: Our Promise

Every person we hire strengthens the soul of Stoic Dreams. That's why we hire slowly, thoughtfully, and with full transparency.
